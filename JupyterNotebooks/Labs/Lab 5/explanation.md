# This is my explanation

1. My idea was to to make 2 functions, one that processes the transactions that only deal with the checking account and one that deals with both checking in saving
2. I then started by making a multiplier for the checking and savings that would be used for the function that uses both accounts
3. Then, I made 2 functions that defined the savings and the checkings
4. After that, I wrote a function that would deal with the transaction amounts in the list that woulf follow. One line deals with the checking transactions, one would deal with both checkings and savings
5. I then wrote the the transaction amounts
6. To close, I reused the code that would display the bank account balances
